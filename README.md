termtable
=========

C library for creating ASCII tabular output.

This was originally implemented as a component of
[FRRouting](https://github.com/FRRouting/frr). It has been pulled out into its
own project and translated to C99 since it's useful on its own.

Usage
-----
See source comments in `src/termtable.h`.
